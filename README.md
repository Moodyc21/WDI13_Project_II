- I downloaded images from google for users and their skatebaords.
-Media Query with responsive design

## Version 2 
-> I would like to add more functionality with actual product pictures that link and populate a cart. I want to make it more visual. I would like to add more models like decks, trucks and wheels etc. Full CRUD on all these models would be effective in a nice application. I would update my styling to make a cleaner look.   

## Notes to Self
-> Take your time. Do not rush and stay focused on user stories and small goals. Order of operations! Do one thing at a time and stick to your timebox's. This project showed me how far you can go down a rabbit hole and if you stay too long there is no coming back.

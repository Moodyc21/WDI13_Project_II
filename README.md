# WDI13_Project_II
Build_A_Board

## Intro
-> Welcome to Build-A-Board. Come on in. Make yourself a user or pick from our group of users and start your journey to build your own skateboard. After you pick or create a user. Pick or add your own skateshop. Once in a skateshop you can either see a pre-built board and edit it or create a whole new complete from the ground up.

## Technologies
-> Bootstrap
-> JQuery
-> Imported Google fonts 'Righteous' and 'Source Code Pro'
-> I downloaded images from google for users and their skatebaords.
-Media Query with responsive design

## Unsolved Problems
-> Populate pictures for data models
-> Create Full CRUD for all data models
-> Have more than three data models
-> Smoother styling/animations

## Version 2 
-> I would like to add more functionality with actual product pictures that link and populate a cart. I want to make it more visual. I would like to add more models like decks, trucks and wheels etc. Full CRUD on all these models would be effective in a nice application. I would update my styling to make a cleaner look. I want to make this a full board builder with a shopping cart and users who log in with accounts. They can come online and buy from sourced products from different companies online.

## Notes to Self
-> Take your time. Do not rush and stay focused on user stories and small goals. Order of operations! Do one thing at a time and stick to your timebox's. This project showed me how far you can go down a rabbit hole and if you stay too long there is no coming back.
